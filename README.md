**The use of .gitignore**
The use of the .gitignore file in every project is because they tell Git which files to ignore when I commit
projects on Github because they may contain sensitive security information about the device I use such as API keys or
credentials that I would need to keep private

**Storage of of credentials and sensitive information**
The storage of sensitive information will be encrypted using git-crypt which protects files after they have been
commited and both public and private content can be shared simultaneously and stops the need of privatizing the whole repository.
