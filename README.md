**The use of .gitignore**
-The use of the .gitignore file in every project is because they tell Git which files to ignore when I commit
projects on Github because they may contain sensitive security information about the device I use such as API keys or
credentials that I would need to keep private
- Deploying Keys
-Git Secrets

**Storage of of credentials and sensitive information**
The storage of sensitive information will be encrypted using git-crypt which protects files after they have been
commited and both public and private content can be shared simultaneously and stops the need of privatizing the whole repository.

**Project 2**

The project I created is called ApiProject and the reason for the creation of this project is to have a project that is hosted on an online server and a database in which data can be stored on a cloud so data can be accessed remotely from anywhere as long as that data is being requested. The project has a: -GET request that allows the user to retrieve any item from the database model. -POST request that allows the user to add any new item into the database model. -PUT request that allows the user to fully update any item from the database model. -PATCH request that allows the user to partially update any item from the database model. -DELETE request that allows the user to remove any item from the database model.

The end points of every possible HTTP request will be uploaded and it will allow the stakeholders to use them as they will be granted permission to make theses requests to the database. So the stakeholders will need password and username to access the database and make actual internal changes.

**Project 3**

This project is a MVC project that implements Architectural design patterns and that means certain principles must be followed.

The use of this project will be as follows:

Access: -The user will have to register in order to use the application.

If the user already has an account, the can just use their credentials to sign in
Categories: -If the user wishes to view all the within the database, they will be show here.

If the user wishes to view the details of the details of the Item, they can click on the view icon
-If the user wishes to Remove any the within the database, they can do so by clicking the felete button and confirmation will be asked for that operation.

Devices: -If the user wishes to view all the Devices within the database, they will be show here.

If the user wishes to view the details of the details of the Item, they can click on the view icon
-If the user wishes to Remove any the within the database, they can do so by clicking the felete button and confirmation will be asked for that operation.

Zones: -If the user wishes to view all the Zones within the database, they will be show here.

If the user wishes to view the details of the details of the Item, they can click on the view icon
-If the user wishes to Remove any the within the database, they can do so by clicking the felete button and confirmation will be asked for that operation.

Logout: If the user wishes to log out of the application, a button for that function is available.

***Project 4*

For this project I am performing User Acceptance testing and Robotic Process Automations to test whether the input is valid or not
or if the system is capable of handling any possible errors appropriately from using information for a provided source in an excel
sheet to upload it on a web application through automation only.


**Project 5**

This is a report that visualizes and summarires data pertaining to the Devices,Device(categories)and Device(zones) and all numerical information. This report is intended for the use of influencing executive decision making by proving the stakeholders with the relevant information.

How the report wil be used: There are pages Namely:

-High-leve Metrics which when clicked upon will display all key infomartion which was summarised for the intention of influencing executive decision making.

-Device Monitoring which when clicked on, will display the visual on current device numbers,created date and status which is a tab basically used for monitoring all existing devices.

-Device Registration visualizes the dates,numbers and categories of all device registration dates.

There are also page and visual filters which can be used to withdraw only required information when required.
